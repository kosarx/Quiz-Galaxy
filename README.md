Note: Quiz-Galaxy was a project developed by a very young person, diving into multiple web technologies all at once. All sections, all code developed should be scrutinized to heck and back. Originally, deployed to Heroku, it is now homeless, but you can run it through router.py and browsing to http://localhost:5000.
